# pyPhpTree module

Module is a tiny parser of PHP source code, which finds lines with "class"/"function" declarations. It reads PHP code only inside `<? .. ?>` tags (any count of fragments in one file), and only outside of `/* .. */` comments.

Function

    def get_headers(lines)
  
finds all classes/functions in PHP source code ("lines" list), and gives list of tuples:

    (line_index, level, caption, kind)
  
Fields:

- line_index: 0-based line index in the "lines" list.
- level: 0-based level of item. each item of level K+1 is nested into (nearest higher) item of level K.
- caption: name of class/function.
- kind: kind of item: "c" for class, "f" for function.
