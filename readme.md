# pyPhpTree module

Module is a tiny parser of PHP source code, which finds lines with "class"/"function" declarations. It reads PHP code only inside `<? ... ?>` tags (any count of fragments in one file), and outside of `/* ... */` and `// ...` comments, and outside of single/double-quoted strings (multi-line strings supported, escape backslash supported).

# API

Function `get_headers(filename, lines)` finds all classes/functions, in given "lines" list, and gets dicts:

    {
      'line': int,      # 0-based line index in the "lines" list
      'level': int,     # 0-based level of item. each item of level K+1
                        # is nested into (nearest higher) item of level K
      'name': str,      # name of class/function
      'name_x': int,    # 0-based position in line, where name found
      'kind': str,      # "c" for class, "f" for function
    }
    
It's generator (yield), so to get list, use `list(get_headers(...))`.
